# WealthPulse (Zig Version)

The only thing I can do is rewrite the same app in different languages. Here we
go with Zig.

This is probably going to be a challenge, since there's no UTF support, no HTTP
client, no decimals, etc, and the language is pre-1.0.

But maybe at least I can write a fast, portable parser library for the ledger
file that I can use anywhere else?
